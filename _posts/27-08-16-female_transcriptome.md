Our new preprint, ['Transcriptomic Description of an Endogenous Female State in C. elegans']() was posted in Biorxiv today.

Please read it and comment -- we will continue to modify the text and figures to improve the manuscript before peer-review, so any and all criticism is welcome!

The github repository has been made public and can be found [here](https://github.com/WormLabCaltech/Angeles_Leighton_2016). The raw reads will be published to the SRA shortly.
