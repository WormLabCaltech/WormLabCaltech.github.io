David's paper [Tissue Enrichment Analysis for *C. elegans* Genomics](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1229-9) has just been published in BMC Bioinformatics. The tool is also [published in WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/tools/enrichment/tea/tea.cgi), where we hope you can take advantage of it. All you need is a gene list!

The GitHub repo for this project cane be found [here](https://github.com/dangeles/TissueEnrichmentAnalysis), and you can also install our tool using `pip install tissue_enrichment_analysis`
